# Linear Regression on House Price Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of Linear Regression (both Simple and Multiple) to predict house prices using the `Housing.csv` dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
(i) **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and prepares features for regression.

(ii) **Model Training**: Implements both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

(iii) **Evaluation**: Uses MAE, MSE, and R² metrics to assess model performance.

(iv) **Visualization**: Includes plots to compare actual vs. predicted prices.

## Results
1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Achieved an R² score of 0.27.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Achieved an R² score of 0.55, showing better performance with additional features.

## Requirements
(i) Python 3.x

(ii) Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset (`Housing.csv`) contains features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price of houses.
